# Chad Launcher

The new version of Chad Launcher powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.studio).

## Installation

### Build from source

We recommend using `pnpm` to build this project. ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pnpm/))

```
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm tauri build
```

This will create a `chad_launcher` executable, an AppImage and a debian package.

## Development
